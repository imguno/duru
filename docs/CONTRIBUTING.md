# Contributing

English · [한국어](CONTRIBUTING.ko.md)

Start with the [README](../README.md) and reproduce the behavior you want to change.
For a bug, include the package/Python versions, the command or minimal code, expected
behavior, and a redacted error. For an extension, describe the supported operations
and a small working example.

## Local checks

Run the development commands in the README. Use focused tests while working, then
run the relevant integration suite before sharing a change. Keep English and Korean
user documentation aligned. CI checks style, tests, dependency advisories, and
distribution installation; a green local test does not imply CI has run.

Keep credentials injected and source revisions verifiable. Describe URI/name rules
and supported capabilities. Changes to mutation, snapshot or confinement behavior
need contract/race coverage and independent review. Duru has no application scheduler
or document-permission service.

## Pull requests

Describe the user-visible problem and result. Include validation and any migration
requirements. Avoid unrelated rewrites. Never attach real tokens, private documents,
account databases, environment files, or local execution logs containing credentials.

Report vulnerabilities through the private route in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
